Certainly! Here's a non-code interview question related to Next.js routing:

**Question:**
Can you explain the key differences between client-side routing and server-side routing in the context of Next.js? How does Next.js leverage both types of routing, and what advantages does this approach offer in terms of performance and user experience?

**Answer:**
In Next.js, routing is an essential aspect of managing navigation within a web application. Next.js employs a hybrid approach that combines both client-side and server-side routing to optimize performance and improve the user experience.

- **Client-side Routing:**
  - **Handled by the Browser:** In client-side routing, the navigation is handled by the browser using JavaScript.
  - **Faster Transitions:** When moving between pages, only the necessary components are fetched and rendered, making transitions faster and smoother.
  - **Better User Experience:** As only the content that changes is updated, the user experiences quicker page loads after the initial application is loaded.

- **Server-side Routing:**
  - **Handled by the Server:** Server-side routing involves the server generating and delivering the HTML for each page in response to the client's request.
  - **SEO Benefits:** Server-side rendering (SSR) allows search engines to index the content effectively, improving search engine optimization (SEO).
  - **Initial Page Load Performance:** The initial page load may be slower compared to client-side rendering, but subsequent navigations can be faster.

- **Next.js Routing:**
  - **Hybrid Approach:** Next.js combines both client-side and server-side routing for optimal performance.
  - **Automatic Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits the JavaScript code for each page, allowing only the necessary code to be sent to the client, reducing initial load times.
  - **getStaticProps and getServerSideProps:** Next.js provides functions like `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` that allow developers to choose between static generation and server-side rendering based on the needs of specific pages.
  - **Incremental Adoption:** Developers can choose the level of server-side rendering they need, allowing for incremental adoption and optimization based on specific use cases.

**Advantages:**
- **Improved Performance:** By leveraging client-side routing for subsequent navigations and server-side rendering for initial page loads, Next.js achieves a balance between speed and SEO benefits.
- **SEO Optimization:** Server-side rendering ensures that search engines can effectively index the content, improving the website's visibility in search results.
- **Code Splitting:** Automatic code splitting ensures that only the necessary JavaScript code is sent to the client, optimizing the initial page load.

Understanding how Next.js combines client-side and server-side routing helps developers make informed decisions about when to use static generation, server-side rendering, or client-side rendering for different parts of their applications.
