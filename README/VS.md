As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Next.js had introduced the concept of "Server Components," but keep in mind that there may have been updates or changes to Next.js after that date. Please refer to the official Next.js documentation for the most up-to-date information.

As of my last update:

1. **Client-Side Components:**
   - Traditional React components in Next.js are primarily rendered on the client side. The component logic is executed in the browser after the initial HTML and JavaScript are loaded.
   - Changes to the UI and interactions are handled on the client side without requiring a full page reload.
   - Client-side rendering is suitable for components that don't require server-side logic and can be handled entirely on the client.

2. **Server-Side Components (Experimental):**
   - Next.js introduced the experimental concept of "Server Components" to enable rendering components on the server side.
   - Server Components allow parts of a page to be rendered on the server, providing the potential for more efficient rendering and better performance.
   - Server Components are currently marked as experimental, and their usage may evolve as the Next.js team refines and stabilizes this feature.

It's essential to note that the introduction of Server Components is part of Next.js's ongoing effort to provide more flexibility and optimize performance for specific use cases. The decision to use client-side components or experiment with server-side components depends on the requirements of your application and the specific performance characteristics you're aiming for.

For the most accurate and up-to-date information on Server Components in Next.js, please refer to the official Next.js documentation and any release notes or announcements provided by the Next.js team. Keep in mind that experimental features might undergo changes or refinements as they progress towards stable releases.
